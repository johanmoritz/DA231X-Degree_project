\section{Model evaluation}

To evaluate the correctness of the TLA\textsuperscript+ model, a number of scenarios are tested with the TLC model checker. Because TLC is a bounded model checker, these scenarios do not prove the correctness of the model in general but gives an indication to under which assumptions it is correct. Particularly, they are selected to show that the system makes progress in non-trivial cases, rather than stopping in a deadlocked state, and that it yields valid results. In all scenarios, a limit as well as goal is set in terms of the number of packages the system should evaluate correctly before finishing. In other words, for each behaviour (or state sequence) that is tested in a scenario, either the goal is reached or the model has failed the scenario.

\subsection{Scenario 1: No malicious builders}
\label{subsec:scenario_non-malicious}

This scenario is a positive test of the model where every builder is assumed to take egoistical but non-malicious actions, following the behaviour described under section \ref{sec:systemActors}. There are three total builders, each one with two preferred packages at a vote target of two. Two of the builders begin with 0BT in their respective wallets while the third one starts with 3BT. This allows the last builder to initialize the first package judgment, because 3BT is exactly the cost for a package with a vote target of two. The judgment goal of the scenario scales from one up to and including four, thus ensuring that the initially preferred packages of at least one builder have been judged.

\subsection{Scenario 2: Single malicious builder}
\label{subsec:scenario_single_malicious}

To test the model under a more realistic scenario, this scenario extends the one in \ref{subsec:scenario_non-malicious} with a malicious builder. The malicious builder acts similarly to the builders from \ref{sec:systemActors}, but will always judge packages incorrectly. With the added malicious builder, this scenario has a total of four builders. To improve model checking time with the additional builder, the judgment goal is lessened to up to and including two packages. The main purpose of this scenario is to ensure that the model works as intended when not all judgments are the equal.

\section{Analysis of system properties}

The following section argue the the general system properties that can be inferred by the results and system description.

\subsection{Safety}
\label{subsec:AnalysisSafety}

The safety property of the system as stated in section \ref{sec:modelCorrectness} says that no packages should be wrongly judged. This is determined by the model checker as described in section \ref{subsec:ModelModelCorrectness}. Given the successfully finished model checking results noted in tables \ref{table:no_malicious_builders} and \ref{table:one_malicious_builder} and assuming the model represents a real implementation, this property hold for the system.

\subsection{Progress}
\label{subsec:AnalysisProgress}

System progress has been shown by a combination of the model package judgment goal described in section \ref{subsec:ModelCheckingGoal} and the builtin deadlock testing the model checker performs. Because every goal was reached successfully without reaching a deadlocked state, a system based on the model should be able to progress as well.

\subsection{Balanced ownership}
\label{subsec:AnalysisBalanced}

Intuitively from the multi-package algorithm description in section \ref{subsec:AlgorithmMulti}, it can be understood that no builder could singlehandedly decide what packages should be judged. If a builder would try such a thing, their wallets would be emptied out to pay for the judgments they initialize. At this point they would have to judge packages for others, thus proving they would not be able to control the system.

\subsection{Decentralized distribution}
\label{subsec:AnalysisDecentralized}

Because the system is designed on top of Hyperledger Fabric, the \glsentryshort{DLT}s properties benefit the system as well. One of these is the fact that the network and the data stored on the network is distributed and not centralized. This implies that the reproducibility of packages stored in the system has decentralized distribution as well.

\subsection{Traceability}
\label{subsec:AnalysisTraceability}

Similarly to section \ref{subsec:AnalysisDecentralized}, any package judgment result can be traced back through the transaction history stored on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. The main events of a package judgment is also stored on the world-state itself, as shown in the model description under section \ref{subsec:ModelChaincode}, which acts to increase the traceability for how a particular result was decided.

\subsection{Integrity of results}
\label{subsec:AnalysisIntegrity}

As an additional benefit to being built on top of Hyperledger Fabric, the results stored on the system can only be changed by a consensus of actors. The threat from single participating malicious actors is therefore slim.

\subsection{Collusion-free}
\label{subsec:AnalysisCollusionFree}

Assuming that actors do not communicate outside of the network as stated in section \ref{sec:systemActors}, the single-package algorithm described in section \ref{subsec:AlgorithmSingle} stops collusion and improper knowledge sharing within the system due to the votes hidden nature.
