\section{Model bounds}

While the model checking runs successfully in the scenarios laid out in section \ref{sec:model_evaluation}, these are all artificially limited in their size. As can be noted from the results, the time it takes to model check each scenario grows significantly with the bounds of the model. The upper limit of these scenarios are therefore in practice bounded by compute time. The consequence of this limit is that the model is not verified to work successfully with higher goals or in larger networks, although there is little to suggest that such an extension would significantly change the models behavior in practice.
