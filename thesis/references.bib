To facilitate the selection of suitable {DLT} designs, we review {DLT} characteristics and identify trade-offs between them. Furthermore, we assess how {DLT} designs account for these trade-offs and we develop archetypes for {DLT} designs that cater to specific requirements of applications on {DLT}. The main purpose of our article is to introduce scientific and practical audiences to the intricacies of {DLT} designs and to support development of viable applications on {DLT}.},

We ﬁrst deﬁne the problem, and then provide insight into the challenges of making real-world software build in a “reproducible” manner—this is, when every build generates bit-for-bit identical results.

By the help of this disruptive technology a peer-to-peer network can be formed where nodes have to reach a consensus and form a chain from accepted blocks, while no central party or trusted controller is required. Among all the existing uses of this technology, decentralized storage systems are one of its prominent applications. Decentralized storage networks, are consisted of a group of people willing to rent out their unused hardware storage space. By implementing end-to-end encryption clients can securely transmit their ﬁles through a fully decentralized network and eliminate the risk of data failures that arise from centralized controls. In this network, storage providers are required to prove that they store unaltered ﬁles during the time. Also a smart contract between two parties is set out in which rental duration and cost that the customer needs to pay for using that storage space is clariﬁed. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the blockchain-based storage systems and how they work and then compares them with cloud-based storage networks. Also different techniques of consensus protocols in each group are explored. Next, we have an overview on the advantages and also weak points of blockchain-based storage systems. Finally, we discuss about future research directions.},

Blockchain has solved the problem of changing the original low-trust centralized ledger held by a single third-party, to a high-trust decentralized form held by different entities, or in other words, verifying nodes. The key contribution of the work of Blockchain is the consensus algorithm, which decides how agreement is made to append a new block between all nodes in the verifying network. Blockchain algorithms can be categorized into two main groups. The first group is proof-based consensus, which requires the nodes joining the verifying network to show that they are more qualified than the others to do the appending work. The second group is voting-based consensus, which requires nodes in the network to exchange their results of verifying a new block or transaction, before making the final decision. In this paper, we present a review of the Blockchain consensus algorithms that have been researched and that are being applied in some well-known applications at this time.},

Whilst the former have trusted the technical orientation of the triad as a unique point of reference in information security, the latter have questioned the triad’s capacity of addressing the breadth of socio-technical issues that have emerged in security since the 2000s. Through a revisiting of the key tenets of the triad, the paper reconciles these two, seemingly fragmented, approaches. The main argument is that the {CIA} triad will continue to assume a major role in information security practice. However, this is not due to the fact that practitioners have discarded, or rejected the enhancements that socio-technical security scholars have proposed over the years; rather, it is because these enhancements can be accommodated by a broader re-conceptualization of the original {CIA} triad. The paper concludes with potential areas for future research.},

One modular component is a pluggable ordering service that establishes consensus on the order of transactions and batches them into blocks. However, as of the time of this writing, there is no production grade Byzantine Fault-Tolerant ({BFT}) ordering service for Fabric, with the latest version (v2.3) supporting only Crash Fault-Tolerance ({CFT}).In this work we describe the design and implementation of a {BFT} ordering service for Fabric, employing a new {BFT} consensus library. The new library, based on the {BFT}-{SMART} protocol and written in Go, is tailored to the blockchain use-case, yet is general enough to cater to a wide variety of other uses. The {BFT} library's design and integration into Fabric address crucial aspects that were left unsolved in all prior work, making them unfit for production use. We evaluate the new {BFT} ordering service by comparing it with the currently supported Raft-based {CFT} ordering service in Hyperledger Fabric.},

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of {CPU} power. As long as a majority of {CPU} power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

It produces a result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and it is as efﬁcient as Paxos, but its structure is different from Paxos; this makes Raft more understandable than Paxos and also provides a better foundation for building practical systems. In order to enhance understandability, Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as leader election, log replication, and safety, and it enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered. Results from a user study demonstrate that Raft is easier for students to learn than Paxos. Raft also includes a new mechanism for changing the cluster membership, which uses overlapping majorities to guarantee safety.},

  abstract   = {Application management in Linux based operating systems is managed by package managers. The package repositories of most Linux distributions provide software through central servers. While having a central server provides a unique verified and maintained version, servers often separate official and community packages, and users frequently use community packages. However, some highly demanded community packages may not be stored in official repositories. While central servers are open to a single point of failure, using community packages without any security check may be insecure. In this paper, we introduce the idea of a distributed package management architecture for Linux systems based on blockchain technology. In the proposed system, package providers are considered as miners, building a package is mining, and proof-of-work is reproducible packaging by the miners. The blockchain keeps the hash of the package contents. Creating and testing a package will return to the packager as reliability scores. This system will have the following advantages. Packages will be verified through consensus, single points of failure will be eliminated ensuring availability, packages are stored in a distributed network. The goal is to keep the operating system alive with a decentralized, reliable, and transparent blockchain-based package management system.},

  abstract   = {There are a range of package managers out there which are used in almost every software development project to integrate third party packages to a project. These packages are usually stored in central repositories in the cloud. This central cloud approach brings some downsides especially with regard to fault tolerance which we want to tackle with our approach inspired by thoughts of dew computing. In this paper we present a fully distributed package manager which can be used on cloud as well as on the edge or in a hybrid environment. The approach is based on a peer-to-peer network, implemented with hypercore protocol.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an architecture, based on Distributed Ledger Technologies ({DLTs}) and Decentralized File Storage ({DFS}) systems, to support the use of Personal Information Management Systems ({PIMS}). {DLT} and {DFS} are used to manage data sensed by mobile users equipped with devices with sensing capability. {DLTs} guarantee the immutability, traceability and verifiability of references to personal data, that are stored in {DFS}. In fact, the inclusion of data digests in the {DLT} makes it possible to obtain an unalterable reference and a tamper-proof log, while remaining compliant with the regulations on personal data, i.e. {GDPR}. We provide an experimental evaluation on the feasibility of the use of {DFS}. Three different scenarios have been studied: i) a proprietary {IPFS} approach with a dedicated node interfacing with the data producers, ii) a public {IPFS} service and iii) Sia Skynet. Results show that through proper configuration of the system infrastructure, it is viable to build a decentralized Personal Data Storage ({PDS}).},

	title = {A Data Storage Method Based on Blockchain for Decentralization {DNS}},
	doi = {10.1109/DSC.2018.00035},
	abstract = {As a distributed database mapping the domain name and {IP} address, {DNS} makes it easier to access the Internet However, {DNS} relies on the resolution of the root server, which is a hierarchical network topology centered on the root. It is vulnerable to single points of failure and domain name resolution data tampered, affects the normal service of Internet domain name resolution seriously. To solve this problem, we proposed a new blockchain-based decentralization {DNS} data storage method by studying the principle and characteristics of blockchain. And implement a decentralization system {DecDNS} to establish multiple parallel {DNS} nodes, store the key information of the zone file resolution data. In the experiment, we proactively invalidated multiple nodes in the parallel resolution node and tampered the domain name resolution data. The experimental results show that, the {DecDNS} can provide normal resolution services, solve the problem of single point failure and the falsification of domain name resolution data. While compatible with the original domain name system, it is also enhances the stability and security of {DNS} framework, so it is an effective and feasible solution.},
