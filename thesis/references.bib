  abstract     = {When developing peer-to-peer applications on distributed ledger technology ({DLT}), a crucial decision is the selection of a suitable {DLT} design (e.g., Ethereum), because it is hard to change the underlying {DLT} design post hoc. To facilitate the selection of suitable {DLT} designs, we review {DLT} characteristics and identify trade-offs between them. Furthermore, we assess how {DLT} designs account for these trade-offs and we develop archetypes for {DLT} designs that cater to specific requirements of applications on {DLT}. The main purpose of our article is to introduce scientific and practical audiences to the intricacies of {DLT} designs and to support development of viable applications on {DLT}.},

These are typically built and distributed by third-party vendors, with severe security consequences if their supply chains are compromised. In this paper, we present reproducible builds, an approach that can determine whether generated binaries correspond with their original source code. We ﬁrst deﬁne the problem, and then provide insight into the challenges of making real-world software build in a “reproducible” manner—this is, when every build generates bit-for-bit identical results. Through the experience of the Reproducible Builds project making the Debian Linux distribution reproducible, we also describe the afﬁnity between reproducibility and quality assurance ({QA}).},

  abstract     = {Decentralized, distributed storage offers a way to reduce the impact of data silos as often fostered by centralized cloud storage. While the intentions of this trend are not new, the topic gained traction due to technological advancements, most notably blockchain networks. As a consequence, we observe that a new generation of peer-to-peer data networks emerges. In this survey paper, we therefore provide a technical overview of the next generation data networks. We use select data networks to introduce general concepts and to emphasize new developments. Speciﬁcally, we provide a deeper outline of the Interplanetary File System and a general overview of Swarm, the Hypercore Protocol, {SAFE}, Storj, and Arweave. We identify common building blocks and provide a qualitative comparison. From the overview, we derive future challenges and research goals concerning data networks.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain is a new approach to create a distributed network which was ﬁrst introduced in 2008. By the help of this disruptive technology a peer-to-peer network can be formed where nodes have to reach a consensus and form a chain from accepted blocks, while no central party or trusted controller is required. Among all the existing uses of this technology, decentralized storage systems are one of its prominent applications. Decentralized storage networks, are consisted of a group of people willing to rent out their unused hardware storage space. By implementing end-to-end encryption clients can securely transmit their ﬁles through a fully decentralized network and eliminate the risk of data failures that arise from centralized controls. In this network, storage providers are required to prove that they store unaltered ﬁles during the time. Also a smart contract between two parties is set out in which rental duration and cost that the customer needs to pay for using that storage space is clariﬁed. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the blockchain-based storage systems and how they work and then compares them with cloud-based storage networks. Also different techniques of consensus protocols in each group are explored. Next, we have an overview on the advantages and also weak points of blockchain-based storage systems. Finally, we discuss about future research directions.},

	abstract = {Thanks to its potential in many applications, Blockchain has recently been nominated as one of the technologies exciting intense attention. Blockchain has solved the problem of changing the original low-trust centralized ledger held by a single third-party, to a high-trust decentralized form held by different entities, or in other words, verifying nodes. The key contribution of the work of Blockchain is the consensus algorithm, which decides how agreement is made to append a new block between all nodes in the verifying network. Blockchain algorithms can be categorized into two main groups. The first group is proof-based consensus, which requires the nodes joining the verifying network to show that they are more qualified than the others to do the appending work. The second group is voting-based consensus, which requires nodes in the network to exchange their results of verifying a new block or transaction, before making the final decision. In this paper, we present a review of the Blockchain consensus algorithms that have been researched and that are being applied in some well-known applications at this time.},
